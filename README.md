# Harmony and Form in Brazilian Choro: A Corpus Study

## General Information

This project is one of the corpus projects conducted at the [Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab (DCML)](http://dcml.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.

In this repository you will find all transcriptions and analyses once we received the confirmation of the publisher (this is expected to happen in the next weeks).

For any questions regarding this project contact Fabian C. Moss (fabian.moss@epfl.ch) or Willian Fernandes Souza (willianfersou@yahoo.com.br).

## Abstract for ICMPC/ESCOM 2018

**Background**

Digital musicology and computational music analysis have gained momentum in recent years largely due to the increased creation of symbolic corpora. While covering diverse genres, encodings, formats, and methodologies, most datasets concentrate on melody and/or harmony to infer or describe idiosyncrasies of a certain style, genre, or composer, sometimes also considering aspects of formal structure.

**Aims**

The current project contributes to this trend and aims at complementing data-driven approaches by analyzing a genre beyond the canon of both classical and popular music research. We seek to gain insight into the structural features of harmony and form in this particular genre, enabling us to relate them to other corpora. Furthermore, we provide visualizations of the form of each piece in this dataset.

**Methods**

We transcribed chord symbols and the formal structure of the 296 songs from the Choro Songbooks (Chediak, Sève, & Souza, 2009, 2011a, 2011b). Choro comprises three meanings: (1) it is a social musical event, (2) it is a musical genre including various sub-genres, and (3) it is a manner of performing, a musical style. The transcriptions are based on de Clercq & Temperley (2011), and include information about root and bass notes, chord types, added notes, key and meter (global and local), and metadata such as genre, year of composition, and composer. We transposed all chord symbols relative to the global key of the piece and converted the transcriptions into the hierarchical JSON format for statistical analysis and visualization. Subsequently, we applied natural language processing techniques to find patterns on the piece, part, and phrase levels, and interpreted them as expressing important features of the genre.

**Results**

Our findings show that (1) frequency vs. rank of chord symbols reveals an underlying Zipf distribution, typically occurring in musical and linguistic corpora. (2) Moreover, prototypical harmonic sequences, such as subdominant-dominant-tonic patterns, make up a large portion of the whole dataset, albeit there are differences in sub-genres and styles. (3) The formal structure is mostly limited to ternary and Rondo forms, and (4) key and modulation patterns vary between sub-genres. (5) These features can partially be related to diachronic changes within the genre.

**Conclusions**

The analyses of our dataset support theoretical assertions about harmony and form in Choro (Almada, 2006). We deduce that these regularities are informative about stylistic particularities, both for human listeners and algorithms. Thus, our findings can serve as a basis for subsequent music information retrieval applications such as prediction of genre or composer within the style in question, as well as allow for cross-stylistic comparisons.
